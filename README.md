# Pacmen
This is a project I have been working on as an assignment for my MIT boot camp for JS

# Description
Simple program to create Pacmen with a factory. When start is presssed the created Pacmen will bounce around the inside of the screen.

# Usage
Currently made for desktop only. To use, just drag index.html file to your browser tab. Make sure all files are in the same folder.

# Future
I would like to add animation to the Pac man so his mouth isn't stuckl open and looks more professional.I would also like to edit the CSS to make it 
more friendly asthetically.
